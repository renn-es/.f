Minimal dotfiles for all of our [Renn.es](https://renn.es) servers.

This is just because [tarneo's dotfiles repo](https://github.com/tarneaux/.f) includes a LOT of things (wallpapers, GitHub copilot for Neovim, etc.) and therefore has a very large footprint.

This repo aims to provide just the minimal working environment for servers.
